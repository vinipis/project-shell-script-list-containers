# project-shell-script-list-containers
Project to list all containers that are on the active or non active machine, and list it in a text file. Then I use a command to handle these containers, I'm using echo in another text file, but we could initialize all the containers or delete, with the domain of the shell script we can perform several commands using these few command lines.
